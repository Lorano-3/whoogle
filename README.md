# whoogle
This repo will contain a full introduction on how you can use google, without it's disadvantages
More seriously, in this guide you'll learn how **I** installed whoogle using Docker and how I configured my instance. In matter of WHOOGLE itself, see the original project here : https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search. <br>
I won't discuss the merits of running whoogle on your work machine in this guide.

You'll need :
* Docker desktop,
* Visual Studio Code (recommended),
* And a cup of hot chocolate.

## Step 1
**Check if docker is running**

```bash
docker ps
```
This command should return at least this line, and more if containers are running on your docker service
```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE    COMMAND    CREATED     STATUS    PORTS    NAMES
```

## Step 2
**Pull this repository using**
```bash
git pull https://github.com/Lorano-3/whoogle.git
```
**OR download it via this link : https://github.com/Lorano-3/whoogle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip and unzip it in the chosen directory.**

You should get something like this :
```bash
\whoogle\ README.md
        \ anotherFile.temp
```
